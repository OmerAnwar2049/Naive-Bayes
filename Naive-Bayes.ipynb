This is a major difference and shows that the boolean model is more effective.\n"," * Without stopwords there is a slight decline in accuracy of almot 1% in both simple and boolean naive bayes.\n","\n","2. Precision:\n","  * The precision is similar for all 4 datasets.In range of 0.77 to 0.80.\n","  * The precision of boolean Naive Bayes is higher then normal Niave bayes.\n","  * The removal of stop words have increased precion for normal dataset but decreased for boolean data set.\n","\n","3. F1: \n","  * F1 for boolean Naive bayes is 0.02 more on average for boolean Naive Bayes compared with normal Naive Bayes.\n","  * For with/without stop words the effect is almost similar for both Niave Bayes with and without stop words.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":159,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":0},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":15,"status":"ok","timestamp":1622391272617,"user":{"displayName":"Omer Anwar","photoUrl":"","userId":"02895344091745001426"},"user_tz":-300},"id":"FTWE3dmQjc4p","outputId":"9f4b3596-c135-4011-df48-06c939cedc47"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Training Set</th>\n","      <th>Accuracy(%)</th>\n","      <th>Precision</th>\n","      <th>Recall</th>\n","      <th>F1</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Data with stopwords</td>\n","      <td>74.809160</td>\n","      <td>0.776316</td>\n","      <td>0.602041</td>\n","      <td>0.678161</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Data without stopwords</td>\n","      <td>74.427481</td>\n","      <td>0.782313</td>\n","      <td>0.589744</td>\n","      <td>0.672515</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Boolean Data with stopwords</td>\n","      <td>80.152672</td>\n","      <td>0.802469</td>\n","      <td>0.619048</td>\n","      <td>0.698925</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Boolean Data without stopwords</td>\n","      <td>79.007634</td>\n","      <td>0.795031</td>\n","      <td>0.618357</td>\n","      <td>0.695652</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                     Training Set  Accuracy(%)  Precision    Recall        F1\n","0             Data with stopwords    74.809160   0.776316  0.602041  0.678161\n","1          Data without stopwords    74.427481   0.782313  0.589744  0.672515\n","2     Boolean Data with stopwords    80.152672   0.802469  0.619048  0.698925\n","3  Boolean Data without stopwords    79.007634   0.795031  0.618357  0.695652"]},"execution_count":159,"metadata":{"tags":[]},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["Result"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":["7rNn0aLx9kCM","O56bVbpYHqp9","CS70ANHjoH9U","mWayE5lAn8wv","UcYolyJCws2I","k1sn1XCCw4aJ","omkbjvQxmyWv","X2W7QHq9sFB-","oYZ6badjsLiB","4ovg1IG73PUI","Np7cItZNWLF0"],"name":"i18-0562.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
